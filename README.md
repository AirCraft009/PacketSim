## Overwiev

- Simulate a Network with Routers & Hosts
- Send Packets from different hosts to another
- Observe how Packages are encapsulated
- See how Packets travel through the network
- Look at each stop the packet takes from router to router
- Build Network formations and watch OSPF work

## Constraints

- Doesn't support switches
- Only supports /24 networks
- Doesn't support subnetting
- Doesn't use specific cables
- Doesn't emulate tcp or udp behaviour true to source
