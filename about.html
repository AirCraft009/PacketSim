<h5>Limitation of the Simulator</h5>
<p>This simulator is designed for educational purposes and provides a simplified representation of network components and their interactions. It does not encompass all the complexities of real-world networking, such as advanced routing protocols, security features, or performance optimizations. Users should be aware that while the simulator offers a foundational understanding of network concepts, it may not accurately reflect the behavior of actual network devices and configurations.</p>
<p>Each Subnet needs its own router as a gateway to connect to other subnets.</p>
<p>No layer 2 behavior is simulated in this version.</p>
<p>This is also why the simulator doesn't include Switches</p>
<p>Packet loss is generated by the simulator to simulate network conditions but is not transferable to real life.</p>
